Naive approach time: 11.211499 seconds
Set approach time: 0.007003 seconds
Speedup: 1600.9x faster
Results are the same: True
1. Naive approach has O(n*m) complexity:
   • 50,000 * 50,000 = 2,500,000,000 operations
   • Each 'item in arr2' requires linear search

2. Set approach has O(n + m) complexity:
   • 50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 operations
   • Set lookups are on average O(1)
3. Speed difference:
   • Naive: 11.211499 seconds
   • Set: 0.007003 seconds
   • Speedup: 1600.9x faster
